# Weather-Dashboard

 On this weather dashboard I would use two fetch requests that would gather the weather for today and the next four days in any given city that I would search. I would get data like the date, current temps, high and low temps, humidity percentage, and wind speed. I would also pull data that would dynamically change the weather icon.
